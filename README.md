# python-template

This is a skeleton repo to be used as a python template for future projects.

## Guidelines

To make things easier, we're also using Python's [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
tool to deal with code formatting.

When developing code for this repository, please be sure you install the
[pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/#install):

```bash
cd path/to/repo
pre-commit install
```

Afterwards, whenever you try to commit changes, the pre-commit hooks
will run and inform you of possible warnings/errors that must be fixed.
